# UWP
Universal Windows Platform (UWP) code examples. See https://www.redgreencode.com/uwp-c-xaml-mvvm-ef-sqlite/.

This project was an experiment in UWP development with C#, XAML, MVVM, Entity Framework, SQLite, and xUnit.net. It turned into the [Time Tortoise](https://github.com/RedGreenCode/TimeTortoise) project. Head over there for a more real-world example of how to use those technologies.
